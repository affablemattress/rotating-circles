# Sample Solution for the Exemption Project

The solution presented in this repository is to be used only as an example. The code quality and structure is NOT optimal but the 
end product satisfies the project requirements. You can use the code here as a reference point or as a MVP example.

A project introduction document has been shared in the course [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bkdGh66wUN9iAxy9qGR9SsCGe29M1SYV?usp=sharing).  
But as a short intro:  
* You are to write a very basic simulation that draws rotating circles on a window.
* You **must** use [raylib](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bkdGh66wUN9iAxy9qGR9SsCGe29M1SYV?usp=sharing) as the graphics library.
* Any libraries used **must** be linked statically. As an extra, we encourage you to add any open source libraries you use as a Git submodule for ease of use and testing. 
* You **must** use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as the build tool.
* Your code **must** be cross compatibile between Mac, Linux and Windows.
* Your solution **must** be uploaded to GitHub and should be made public.
* Your solution will be tested on a Intel 12th generation machine with a RTX3050 Ti running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS OS.
* Lastly... Please, for the love of god, test your CMake script. It'd be awesome if your code compiled on said machine (e.g. my laptop) with a single command.

*Sample project here is compiled and tested with CMake using VS2022 on a 8th gen. Intel machine running Windows 10*
